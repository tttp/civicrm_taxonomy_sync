One of the difficulties of a CRM is to keep track of the topics of interests of each contact, and update the record accordingly.

One way of identifying what topics are important for a user is to see what they write or comment about. If you write into my "cooking" forum, that's likely you are interested by... "cooking".

This module automatically create a tag in civicrm for each forum, and everytime someone post a topic or a reply, her corresponding contact is tagged with the name of the forum

For those familiar with the module that sync og and groups, that's quite similar but for taxonomy and tags
